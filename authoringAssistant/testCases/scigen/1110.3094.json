Precision (Positive predictive) values ranged from 82.0 to 93.8 for SVM (polynomial degree 1) and from 83.3 to [REPLACE id=\"result1\" value=\"?\"] for NB. Recall (sensitivity) values ranged from 58.3 to 96.2 for SVM (polynomial degree 1) and from 74.7 to 90.3 for NB. SVM tended to offer a reduced level of precision but better recall. In the case of one syndrome (Hemorrhagic) we noticed an unusually low level of recall for SVM but not for NB."
