The first interesting finding is that the AVG COS SIM measure again performs very well: In all three settings, it beats both the system based on general-purpose embeddings (topic wiki) and the one that is adapted to the science domain (topic science), with again the Both setting yielding the best overall result ([REPLACE id=\"num_1\"]). Note that our Both setting is probably the one most similar to the concept input used by Gong et al. (2018)."
